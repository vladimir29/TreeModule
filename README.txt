Generic Tree Python module I made for optimizing a brute-force program. Given a set of numbers, I had to create all possible 
arithmetic expressions using "+"(addition) and "*"(multiplication). While the backtracking solution took about 12 seconds for
a 7-number set, the tree solution took a little more than 2 seconds.
